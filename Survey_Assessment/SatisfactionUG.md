# How Students Spend Their Time

![](SatisfactionUG_files/figure-pdf/show.viz_timehr-1.pdf)
:::

This year student spend more hours (i.e. 21 hours) working on or off campus than previous years. Accordingly, students spend fewer time volunteering. Although percentages of students engaging in different activities are similar across years, we have less students with 8 or more hours of sleep. 

# Students' Educational Resources

Similar percentage are found for students resources (i.e. owning laptops, textbooks, and letter of recommendations) and high school racial background.



# Overall Satisfaction
















::: {.cell}
::: {.cell-output-display}
![](SatisfactionUG_files/figure-pdf/showviz_overall-1.pdf)
:::
:::


Students' overall experiences and engagement of students have decreased across all items this year. Around 4-10% less students are satisfied in services, have their expectations met, and think they'll reenroll.

Areas that may cause the decrease in overall satisfaction may include problems of infrastructure in the dorm (i.e. broken elevators and dirty/moldy toilets). Another problem a few students mentioned is the incidents of sexual assaults, which made students feel unsafe with the student still around. Title Nine survey in 2021 spring indicated that 62% of students experienced Sexual Misconduct (sexual harassment, stalking, dating violence, or sexual violence) at least once.


# Services Usage and Satisfaction

::: {.cell-output-display}
![](SatisfactionUG_files/figure-pdf/showviz_service_hist-1.pdf)
:::

Satisfaction and usage in shuttle both decreased over 10%, compared to 2021. Students indicated that the shuttle's schedule and stops are sometimes unclear/inaccurate. A few students pointed out shuttle being late, lack late-time availability, and do not stop at places that students need to go. 

Satisfaction in Financial Aid service dropped 5%. Students indicated that the process of paying is hard to navigate and errors around financial aid occurs. A few students mentioned unclear information and slow communication from the office. Several students concerned in losing scholarships and not having tuition reduction applied to them. A few students suggested to have more knowledgeable and empathetic staff communicating with them.

 

# Satisfaction in Academic Life, Community, and Resources




















::: {.cell}
::: {.cell-output-display}
![](SatisfactionUG_files/figure-pdf/show.viz_acagrp_satis.his-1.pdf)
:::
:::


Satisfaction in faculty feedback decreased 8%. Many students indicated their professors do not grade assignments timely and respond to their emails. Several students also mentioned that they do not feel professor accommodate students with special needs (i.e. working, second-language, disability) and consider diverse students experiences in class. Several students also mentioned that they feel course, especially core courses, are not structured or organized. Some students indicated that their teachers seem to be unprepared and inexperienced to teach the topic.

Course variety received around 4% less satisfaction. Several students mentioned they hope to have more in-person courses. Many students indicated that there is insufficient course offered or have conflict to select the course they want. A few students also indicated a stressful course registration process with not enough course to register. Some students thus worried about graduating on time due to course unavailability.

Satisfaction in the dining services has been low. This year satisfaction in food availability further dropped 7% and food selection dropped 4%. Food poisoning (including not fully cooked, reuse of food, reports of cockroaches being found) is a problem mentioned by multiple students. Many students also indicated food running out, limited/repetitive option, unhealthy, and lack of late-hour availability (e.g. 1851 late dinner no longer available). Additionally, many students feel disappointed because they do not feel their voice heard due to the unchanged situation in the dining hall. 



# Group Difference Regression











## Group Differences for Satisfaction in Service

Services satisfaction increased for the following groups of students. Pell eligible students have 1.3 more satisfied services than non pell eligible students. Transfer students have 1.5 more satisfied service than non-transfer students. Residents have 0.8 more satisfied services than commuters. Also, for each unit GPA increase, students could have 0.5 more satisfied service.

However, services satisfaction decreased for students at School of Communication and Fashion, as they both have around 1 less satisfied services than students who haven't declared their major.
