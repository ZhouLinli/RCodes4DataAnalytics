# Data Science Ed
Welcome! This repository holds presentation slides I made based on articles and books on data science that I read.

The data science books/articles covers the following contents:

## Relationship between data modeling and data collection
- I explored how to choose data models and how to use the model to improve study design and data collection(i.e. identify important predictors and their interaction relationships, appropriate sampling methods, reliable and valid measurements, plans for missing data).

## Choosing (classic/stochastic) data models
- I first walked through multivariate predictive regression models and justified its advantages over hypothesis testing and classification data models.

- I compared Parametric Regression Models (Linear, logistic, and Cox survival analysis) with Baysian non-parametric Modeling and discussed the assumptions and applications of the two types of models.

## Algorithmic/Machine-learning Data Modeling
- I reviewed mechanisms to improve prediction accuracy by using the Decision Tree, Neural Networkï¼ŒSupport vector machine models.
